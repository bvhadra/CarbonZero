# CarbonZero - SoC Final Project

## 🧐 Problem statement 
As a team we decided to focus on the issue of climate change. Based on our market research we discovered that people want to know what their carbon footprint looks like so that they can do more to reduce their own personal impact in their daily lives. Our problem statement became, "Our planet is warming up, but I don't know what my impact is or how to improve it."

## 💡 Solution  
Our solution was to build CarbonZero - an app which helps give people awareness of their impact on climate change through their daily activities and delivers tailored education on how they could make a positive change.

- All secretive information should be stored in the .env & .gitignore files so that it doesn't get pushed to Github
- Netlify only accepts the lastest version of a library
- Once we started building our app, we realised the importance of having an in-depth component tree
- Pair programming is crucial to collaborate problem solving
- Having a good understanding of our tech stack and being able to justify why we are using it
