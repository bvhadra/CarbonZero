## Problem statement 
As a team we decided to focus on the issue of climate change. Based on our market research we discovered that people want to know what their carbon footprint looks like so that they can do more to reduce their own personal impact in their daily lives. Our problem statement became, "Our planet is warming up, but I don't know what my impact is or how to improve it."

## Solution  
Our solution was to build CarbonZero - an app which helps give people awareness of their impact on climate change through their daily activities and delivers tailored education on how they could make a positive change. 

## MVP 
- A landing page with some facts about environmental issues
- A button on the landing page which allows the users to take the questionnaire
- A series of multiple choice questions which quizzes the users about their carbon footprint 
- A results page which displays the user's carbon footprint and stores their results in a database 
- An actions page with tailored tips/ targets the user can achieve to improve their personal impact
- A sign in page for the user to login to track their progress each time they complete a target
